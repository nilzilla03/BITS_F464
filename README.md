# Machine Learning - BITS F464
Part of the coursework for the BITS 464-Machine Learning course that I did in my 3-2. We had 2 assignments and 1 project. We were given real-world data and asked to implement models in the language of our choice from scratch. My group used Python, with NumPy and Pandas (Scikit and other "ML" libraries were not allowed). The assignments/project and details are as follows:

### 1. Assignment 1 : Diabetes Prediction using Linear Models for Regression and Classification
**Models implemented**: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Batch Gradient Descent, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, Least Squares Classification
### 2. Project : Early Detection of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
**Models implemented**: Naive Bayes Classifier, Perceptron, Artificial Neural Network, Fisher's Linear Discriminant
### 3. Assignment 2 : Community Crime Rate Prediction Using Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines
**Models implemented**: Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Multiclass SVM
